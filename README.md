Modern C++ utility library for isl.

## Build instructions

Dependencies are fetched via git submodules.  Since they don't use cmake, we
rely on cmake external projects to run the autoconf/configure/make toolchain.
This is done by `make pet` below, which only has to run in the first build or
after submodule update.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
// to fix the autoreconf error
touch external/pet/aclocal.m4 external/pet/Makefile.am external/pet/configure external/pet/Makefile.in
cmake .
make pet
make
```

If it does not find clang headers try:
```sh
PATH=/whereLLVMisInstalled/bin
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/whereLLVMisInstalled/lib
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/whereLLVMisInstalled/include
```

Brief explanation:
This is the matchers/builder framework to be used as a source-to-source compiler.

Issues:
Not working with Clang/LLVM 9.0

Tested:
Clang/LLVM 7.0
gcc 5.4.0 20160609
